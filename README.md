This program will allow you to control the backlight of your Asus aura devices using the MQTT protocol. The program uses the AuraSync API to control the backlight. 
 
Requirements:
Windows OS
Asus motherboard with AuraSync support
Old version of Aura Sync (not ArmouryCrate)

I recommend using the latest version of NSSM for autorun.
